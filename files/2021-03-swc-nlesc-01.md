🗒️ Notes
--------

\
 \
 Let\'s start by opening a terminal window (\"Terminal\" app on mac or
Linux, \"git-bash\" on Windows)\
 \
 Here is link to the data that wil be used:\
 <http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/data/data-shell.zip>\
 \

### Exercise 1

\
You can also use two options at the same time. What does the command ls
do when used with the -l option? What about if you use both the -l and
the -h option?\
  \
Some of its output is about properties that we do not cover in this
lesson (such as file permissions and ownership), but the rest should be
useful nevertheless.\
\
(Optional follow up)\
By default ls lists the contents of a directory in alphabetical order by
name. The command ls -t lists items by time of last change instead of
alphabetically. The command ls -r lists the contents of a directory in
reverse order. Which file is displayed last when you combine the -t and
-r flags? Hint: You may need to use the -l flag to see the last changed
dates.\

### Exercise 2

\
Starting from /Users/amanda/data, which of the following commands could
Amanda use to navigate to her home directory, which is /Users/amanda?\
  

1.   cd .
2.  d /
3.  d /home/amanda
4.  d ../..
5.  strong\>cd \~ \# correct
6.  d home
7.  d \~/data/.. \# correct, but unneccessarily cumbersome
8.  strong\>cd \# correct
9.  d ..

### Exercise 3

\
Using the filesystem diagram below, if pwd displays /Users/thing, what
will ls -F ../backup display?\
  

1.  ../backup: No such file or directory
2.  012-12-01 2013-01-08 2013-01-27
3.  012-12-01/ 2013-01-08/ 2013-01-27/
4.  strong\>original/ pnas_final/ pnas_sub/ \# correct

\

### Exercise 4

\
We have seen how to create text files using the nano editor. Now, try
the following command:\
  \
\$ touch my_file.txt\
  \
What did the touch command do? When you look at your current directory
using the GUI file explorer, does the file show up? Use ls -l to inspect
the files.  How large is my_file.txt? When might you want to create a
file this way?\
\
**Solution:** \"touch\" creates empty files. 

### Exercise 5

\
After running the following commands, Jamie realizes that she put the
files sucrose.dat and maltose.dat into the wrong folder. The files
should have been placed in the raw folder.\
  \
\$ ls -F\
Output: analyzed/ raw/\
\$ ls -F analyzed\
Output: fructose.dat glucose.dat maltose.dat sucrose.dat\
\$ cd analyzed\
  \
Fill in the blanks to move these files to the raw/ folder (i.e. the one
she forgot to put them in)\
  \
\$ mv sucrose.dat maltose.dat \_\_\_\_/\_\_\_\_\
\
**Solution:** The correct command is:\
\$ mv sucrose.dat maltose.dat ../raw/\

### Notes

\
 Useful commands to start with:

-    ls : listing files and directories
-   pwd: print current working directory

ls - l\
Commands can have options, introduced by \"-\", e.g. (ls -F) and
arguments telling the program what to operate on (e.g. \"ls -F
Desktop\").\
\
Need help? Type option \"\--help\" after program name (or \"man
\<program name\>\", printing the manual page - press \"q\" to go back to
command line. *NOTE: \"man\" does not work on Windows\'  git-bash shell
- use \"\--help\" instead* )\
Command to move across folders: cd. \"cd Desktop\": (**c**hange
**d**irectory) access desktop directory. To go to parent directory use
special characters \"..\" (\"cd ..\": move to the parent folder)\
ls **-a**\":  show hidden files in a directory (see \".\" = current
directory , \"..\" = parent directory).\
\
Use \"tab\" key for autocompletion! After typing start of a command type
\"tab\" for automatic completion\
\
\"cd\" works with both **relative** path (e.g. \"cd data\", access data
subdirectory) or **absolute** path ( \"cd /home/francesco/data\", move
to this absolute path starting from root). \"\~\" is short for your home
directory.\
Useful shortcuts: \"cd -\" move to previous directory, \"cd\" (without
argument) goes to home directory\
\
\"mkdir\" : **m**a**k**e **dir**ectory, command to make directories
(e.g. \"mkdir thesis\" creates thesis directory). Only creates a single
directory (no recursive subdirs). Option \"-p\": make full sub-folder
structure (e.g. \"mkdir thesis/chapter_1/section_1\", creates thesis and
all the other subdirs). \
\
NOTE: choose proper names for files/directories:

-   Try avoiding spaces in the names! Use \"\_\" and \"-\" to separate
    words
-   Do not start with \"-\" (this is used for options)
-   Do not use other special characters (NOT use: &\$@)

\
Text editor for command shell: \"nano\", basic editor (e.g. \"nano
draft.txt\" open file and start editing it). Useful commands within
nano:

-   ctrl+X: exit file (need to press \"y\" afterwards)
-   ctrl+O: save content to file

\
File extension (ending of file): does not define content of file - but
it is used for programs (and users) to understand what the content is!\
\
Rename files/directories: \"mv\" (**m**o**v**e), example: \"mv
thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt\" renames the file. Attention: if
target file exists it will be overwritten! Use \"-i\" option for
\"interactive\" usage (asks for confirmation if target file exists). \
\
\"mv\" also moves files across directories: \"mv thesis/quotes.txt . \"
moves the file \"quotes.txt\" to the current directory.\
\
**Coffee/Tea break - back at 10:50! **\
\
Copy files: \"cp\" (**c**o**p**y). example: \"cp quotes.txt
thesis/quotations.txt\" copy the file \"quotes.txt\" from the current
directory to the \"thesis\" folder. Only works for file, to copy
directories use the \"-r\" (recursive) option: \"cp -r thesis
backup/\". \
\
TIP: apart from \"tab\" for autocompletion you can use \"up\" arrow to
scroll through the history of commands you just typed! The command
\"history\" also shows you your history\]\

### Exercise 6 

\
\
Suppose that you created a plain-text file in your current directory to
contain a list of the statistical tests you will need to do to analyze
your data, and named it: statstics.txt\
  \
After creating and saving this file you realize you misspelled the
filename! You want to correct the mistake, which of the following
commands could you use to do so?\
  

1.   cp statstics.txt statistics.txt
2.  v statstics.txt statistics.txt
3.  v statstics.txt .
4.  p statstics.txt .

\
**Solution:** The correct answer is 2. 

### Exercise 7

\
\
What is the output of the closing ls command in the sequence shown
below?\
\
\$ pwd\
Output: /Users/jamie/data\
\$ ls\
Output: proteins.dat\
\$mkdir recombined\
\$mv proteins.dat recombined/\
\$cp recombined/proteins.dat ../proteins-saved.dat\
\$ls\
  

1.  roteins-saved.dat recombined
2.  ecombined
3.  roteins.dat recombined
4.  roteins-saved.dat

\
**Solution:** The correct answer is 2.

### Notes 

\
How to remove files: command \"rm\" (**r**e**m**ove). Example: \"rm
quotes.txt\" removes the \"quotes.txt\" file. ATTENTION! There is no
trash bin for the shell - \"rm\" removes permanently file(s)! To be
safer: use \"-i\" (interactive) option, which asks for confirmation.
Works only for files, use \"-r\" for directories (and all subdir - so be
extra CAREFUL!). \
\
Wildcards: special characters to address multiple files:

-   \"\*\", meaning \"all characters\", example: \"ls \*.pdb\" list all
    files that ends in \".pdb\"
-   \"?\", same as before but replace to only one character, example:
    \"ls ?.pdb\" list all files whose name is one-characther long, with
    extension \".pdb\"

### Exercise 8 

\
\
When run in the molecules directory, which ls command(s) will produce
this output?\
  \
ethane.pdb   methane.pdb\
  

1.  ls \*t\*ane.pdb
2.  s \*t?ne.\*
3.  s \*t??ne.pdb
4.  s ethane.\*

\
**Solution:** The correct answer is 3.

### **Notes **

\
TIP: if you are stuck in the shell, with the prompt asking for user
input: try \"ctrl+C\" or \"ctrl+D\" to go back to the command line.

### Exercise 9 

\
\
Jamie is working on a project and she sees that her files aren't very
well organized:\
\$ ls -F\
analyzed/  fructose.dat    raw/   sucrose.dat\
  \
The fructose.dat and sucrose.dat files contain output from her data
analysis. What command(s) covered in this lesson does she need to run so
that the commands below will produce the output shown?\
  \
\$ ls -F\
analyzed/   raw/\
  \
\$ ls analyzed\
fructose.dat    sucrose.dat\
\
**Solution:** We need to move \"fructose.dat\" and \"sucrose.dat\" to
the \"analyzed\" folder.  Two options to obtain the same result:

-   Option 1:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   v fructose.dat sucrose.dat analyzed/.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Option 2:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   v \*.dat analyzed/

Notes 
------

\
**Coffee/tea break - Back at 12:00!**\
\
\"wc\": Count number of lines/words/characters in a file (or multiple
files). Example: \"wc cubane.pdb\" or \"wc \*.pdb\". If I want only
number of lines, use \"-l\" option (\"-w\" for words, \"-m\" for
characters).\
\
To direct output of a program to a file: \"\>\". Example: \"wc -l \*.pdb
\> lengths.txt\" direct output of command to file \"lengths.txt\".\
\
\"cat\": show content of file(s). Example: \"cat ethane.pdb\" shows
content of \"ethane.pdb\" \
\
\"less\": similar to \"cat\" but shows content page by page (press space
for going to next page, \"q\" for closing )\

### Exercise 10

\
If we run sort on a file containing the following lines:\
10\
2\
19\
22\
6\
  \
the output is:\
10\
19\
2\
22\
6\
  \
If we run sort -n on the same input, we get this instead:\
2\
6\
10\
19\
22\
  \
Explain why -n has this effect.\
\
**Solution: \"**sort\" sorts elements alphabetically (or better
alphanumerically), with \"-n\" sort elements numerically

### Notes

\
\"head\": shows top few lines of file (\"-n\" option to specify how many
lines we want). Example: \"head -n 1 sorted.txt\" prints the first line
of the file \"sorted.txt\"\
\
\"echo\": print the following text. Example: \"echo Hello world\" shows
\"Hello world\"

### Exercise 11 

\
We have seen the use of \>, but there is a similar operator \>\> which
works slightly differently. We'll learn about the differences between
these two operators by printing some strings. We can use the echo
command to print strings e.g.\
  \
\$ echo The echo command prints text\
  \
The echo command prints text\
  \
  \
Now test the commands below to reveal the difference between the two
operators:\
  \
\$ echo hello \> testfile01.txt\
  \
and:\
  \
\$ echo hello \>\> testfile02.txt\
  \
Hint: Try executing each command twice in a row and then examining the
output files.\
\
**Solution:** The difference is:

-   \"\>\" redirects output to file and it overwrites it if it exists. 
-   \"\>\>\" appends output to file if it exists. 

### Exercise 12

\
\
We have already met the head command, which prints lines from the start
of a file. tail is similar, but prints lines from the end of a file
instead.\
  \
Consider the file data-shell/data/animals.txt. After these commands,
select the answer that corresponds to the file animals-subset.txt:\
  \
\$ head -n 3 animals.txt \> animals-subset.txt\$ tail -n 2 animals.txt
\>\> animals-subset.txt\
  

1.  he first three lines of animals.txt
2.  he last two lines of animals.txt
3.  he first three lines and the last two lines of animals.txt
4.  he second and third lines of animals.txt

\
**Solution:** Answer 3. is correct

### Notes

\
How to concatenate commands without writing intermediate steps into
files? Use \"\|\" (pipe symbol). Example: \"wc -l \*.pdb \| sort -n \|
head -n 1\" counts lines in all files, then sort output numerically,
finally print only top line.

### Exercise 13

\
\
In our current directory, we want to find the 3 files which have the
least number of lines. Which command listed below would work?\
  

1.  wc -l \* \> sort -n \> head -n 3
2.  c -l \* \| sort -n \| head -n 1-3
3.  c -l \* \| head -n 3 \| sort -n
4.  c -l \* \| sort -n \| head -n 3

\
**Solution:** The correct answer is 4.

### Exercise 14 

\
\
A file called animals.txt (in the data-shell/data folder) contains the
following data:\
  \
2012-11-05,deer\
2012-11-05,rabbit\
2012-11-05,raccoon\
2012-11-06,rabbit\
2012-11-06,deer\
2012-11-06,fox\
2012-11-07,rabbit\
2012-11-07,bear\
  \
What text passes through each of the pipes and the final redirect in the
pipeline below?\
  \
\$ cat animals.txt \| head -n 5 \| tail -n 3 \| sort -r \> final.txt\
  \
Hint: build the pipeline up one command at a time to test your
understanding\
\
**Solution:** It should contain the following lines:\
2012-11-06,rabbit\
2012-11-06,deer\
2012-11-05,raccoon

### Notes 

\
\"cut\": split columns of a file, by default using \"tab\" as delimiter,
but one can specify custom one using \"-d\" (delimiter). Use \"-f\"
option to select which field to print. Example: \"cut -d , -f 2
animals.txt\" separate columns in \"animals.txt\" using \",\" as
delimiter, and print the second column.\

Feedback

### Tip (something we can improve)

\
Some more examples when and how you may need these commands in real
life.\
More exercises because someone is faster than the other\
Some extra optional exercises in case you go through them quickly+1
+1+1+1\
Using different fonts for shell commands (or later programming code),
e.g. markdown \`\`\`\
Sometimes it went a bit fast, also because I was inclined to make notes
anyway. Perhaps an overview document of all commands used could be
nice!\
This interactive document is a bit tricky to work with (everyone typing
at the same time) and its not very structured. +1\
Also, it would be nice to discuss the commands themselves in a bit more
detail. What do the acronyms represent etc.? \
In some exercises: better prepare the test data set so we don\'t have to
create the structure used in the examples+1\
Next time: real life course instead of virtual :-)\
Some parts were quite fast, but it was a good overview. It would be good
if all examples were based on the actual data, eg, Jamie, Amanda
examples +1\
I think people of very different levels were participating. Possibly,
more focus should be given to the pre-course survey\
Would be interesting to see briefly a real case where today\'s content
(or part of it) was applied.
