🗒️ Notes and exercises
----------------------

### Exercise 1

\
\
Which command(s) below would save the changes of myfile.txt to my local
Git repository?

1.  it commit -m \"my recent changes\" 
2.  git init myfile.txt and git commit -m \"my recent changes\"
3.  it add myfile.txt and git commit -m \"my recent
    changes\"+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1
4.  it commit -m myfile.txt \"my recent changes\"

### Exercise 2

\
\
Jennifer has made changes to the Python script that she has been working
on for weeks, and the modifications she made this morning "broke" the
script and it no longer runs. She has spent \~ 1hr trying to fix it,
with no luck...\
Luckily, she has been keeping track of her project's versions using Git!
Which commands below will let her recover the last committed version of
her Python script called data_cruncher.py?

1.  git checkout HEAD

2\. \$ git checkout HEAD data_cruncher.py\
3. \$ git checkout HEAD\~1 data_cruncher.py\
4. \$ git checkout \<unique ID of last commit\> data_cruncher.py\
5. Both 2 and 4 +1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1\

Feedback

### Tip (what to improve)

\
Perhaps a couple more exercises for us to practice. +1+1+1\
First day was a bit more \'active learning\', I would have liked a few
more moments to practice and get our hands dirty+1\
Show a GUI variant of git for comparison\
I appreciate all the questions answered, but perhaps sometimes the
answers can be kept shorter. I realize it is hard online to see if
someone gets it, but perhaps ask \'Did I answer your question?\'
occasionally or something rather than being very extensive (which can be
too extensive).\
I need some time to grasp why you would use the command line for this -
some commands were straigtforward, but others seem a bit more simple via
github.com 

### Top (what went well)

\
Greater teacher - thank you very much for your enthusiasm! - for what is
a difficult topic+1+1\
Thanks for sharing the code in the collaborative document, it made it a
lot easier to follow the explanations!+1\
I had a git(hub) workshop before and it didn\'t click, this time it did
so that\'s great! Clear instructions and easy to follow along. I enjoyed
working with the examples.\
Very clear explanations. I especially like the analogies and the
descriptions of what the commands do specifically. +1+1+1\
The log of the commands in the collaborative document was/is very
useful!\
The Helpers + Instructor combination works very well as well.\
Clear step by step instruction where you keep everyone on board+1+1\
Really clear instructions, I liked it a lot

📚 Resources 
------------

\
Googling git + the name of your IDE can be a good idea. There are really
good graphical user interfaces for pyCharm and RStudio. There also exist
a good collection of language-independent graphical user interfaces for
git\
Ways to organise your code with version control:

-   GitHub Flow: <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/>
