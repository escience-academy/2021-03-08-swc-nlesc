🧑‍💻 Commands History
--------------------

\
\# To start jupyter-lab from a terminal type\
jupyter lab\
\
\# On Windows, you can also start it via the \"Anaconda Navigator\"\
\
Once selected \"Markdown\" for a cell (all the following will render
nicely):\
\
\# Day 3\
\
\#\# What is markdown\
\
Markdown is a \*plain-text\* \...\
\
See \[this link\](https://github.com)\
\
The following will be executed in \"Code\" cells:\
\
age = 36\
name = \'Pablo\'\
\
age - 6\
\
print(name, \'is\', age, \'years old\')\
\
name + 1         \# will raise TypeError\
\
name\[1\] \# will return \'a\'\
name\[0\] \# will return \'P\'  - Python has zero-based indexing\
\
name\[4\] \# will return \'o\'\
name\[len(name)-1\] \# will also return \'o\'\
name\[-1\] \# will also return \'o\'\
\
name\[1:4\] \# from second to fourth element\
name\[1:4:2\] \# same as above, with step 2\
\
type(age)  \# int\
type(name)  \# str\
\
age_str = \'36\'\
type(age_str)      \# str\
\
age_str \* 3      \# \'363636\'\
int(age_str) \* 3      \# 108\
\
\#\# **Coffee/Tea break - back at 10:40!**\
\
\# ask for help\
print? \
help(print)\
print \# then press Shift + Tab\
\
var = 3.1416\
round(var)\
round(var, 2)\
\
my_string = \'Today is Wednesday\'\
len(my_string)      \# function \"len\" applied on \"my_string\"\
my_string.upper()      \# function in an object is called method \
\
\# Libraries\
\
import math\
\
math.pi\
\
\# \"pi\" becomes directly accessible if you run the following: from
math import pi\
\# you can also change the name of the library in your namespace: import
math as m\
\
math.log10(10)\
math.log10(0)   \# raises ValueError\
\
\# Reading tabular data\
\
import pandas as pd\
\
data_oceania = pd.read_csv(\'data/gapminder_gdp_oceania.csv\')\
data_oceania       \# this will show us the table\
\
data_oceania = pd.read_csv(\'data/gapminder_gdp_oceania.csv\',
index_col=\'country\')\
\
data_oceania.loc(\'Australia\')\
\
data_oceania.describe()\
\
data_oceania.T\
\
data_oceania.columns\
\
data_europe = pd.read_csv(\'data/gapminder_gdp_europe.csv\',
index_col=\'country\')\
\
data_europe.iloc\[0, 0\]   \# get element on row 0, column 0\
data_europe.loc\[\"Albania\", \"gdpPercap_1952\"\]   \# same as above,
but using row and column identifiers \
\
data_europe.loc\[\"Belgium\":\"Denmark\",
\"gdpPercap_1962\":\"gdpPercap_1972\"\]    \# includes final element -
vs. vectors/strings\
\
data_europe.loc\[\"Belgium\":\"Denmark\",
\"gdpPercap_1962\":\"gdpPercap_1972\"\].max()  \# subset of initial
table, then take max values for each column\
\
\# same as above - but split in two steps\
subset_europe = data_europe.loc\[\"Belgium\":\"Denmark\",
\"gdpPercap_1962\":\"gdpPercap_1972\"\]\
subset_europe.max()\
\
subset_europe \> 10000\
subset_europe \> subset_europe.mean()\
\
mask = (subset_europe \> subset_europe.mean())\
subset_europe\[mask\]\
\
subset_europe.to_csv(\'data/subset.csv\')\
\
\# step 1: compare all points with the average\
mask_higher = (data_europe \> data_europe.mean())\
\
\# step 2: count how many times a country was above average - divided by
number of points\
mask_higher.aggregate(\'sum\', axis=1) / len(mask_higher.columns)\

🗒️ Notes and exercises
----------------------

\
 

### Exercise 1

\
 \
 How would you extract the third letter?\
 \
 name\[2\]+1+1+1+1+1\
 \
 How would you extract the last letter?\
 name\[-1\] / name\[4\]+1+1+1 +1\
\
name\[len(name)-1\]\
\
c. How would you extract the three letters in the middle? (i.e.:
\'abl\')\
print(name\[1:4\])   and   name\[1:4\] +1+1+1+1\
name\[1\],name\[2\],name\[3\]\
name\[1:-1\] also

### Exercise 2 

\
\
Find a way of rounding numbers and apply it to \"var\"\
round(var)+1+1+1+1+1+1+1\
\
3 is a very bad approximation of pi. What if want to round it to two
decimals? (i.e.: 3.14)\
round(var,2) +1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1\
eventually:  var = round(3.1416, 2), var=round(math.pi, 2)\
round(var, ndigits=2)+1

### Exercise 3

\
Imagine you are doing medical research, and you need to randomly select
one of your patients. Is there a way of getting random integers with
Python? Which package can help you with this?\
random+1+1+1+1+1+1+1\
random.choice+1\
random.randint(x,y)\
numpy.random

### Exercise 4

\
Use Python for calculating the decimal logarithm of 10\
for e log: math.log(10)+1+1\
for 10log: math.log10(10)\
for 10log: math.log(10,10)\
numpy.log10(10)+1\
\
and of 0\
for e log: math.log(0) \--\> this crashes because this is undefined+1\
for 10 log: math.log10(0) \--\> this crashes because this is undefined\
numpy.log10(0) -\> -inf+1

### Exercise 5

\
Extract the column names from data_oceania\
data_oceania.columns+1+1+1++1

### Exercise 6

\
\
Which countries in subset_europe had a gdp above the subset average?\
new_subset=subset_europe\>(subset_europe.mean())\
subset_europe \> subset_europe.mean()\
\
subset_europe_mean = subset_europe.mean() ==\>\> subset_europe \>
subset_europe_mean\
subset_europe \> subset_europe.mean().mean() \# for the mean over all
the years\

Feedback
--------

### Tip (what to improve)

\
Python was awesome, adding R would be great!\
would be nice to have a little introduction of the software we had to
install\
the start was a bit hectic for me today, to download and install the
dataset, maybe that can be done in advance. In the beginning I got a bit
lost.\

### Top (what went well)

\
Amazing teaching! The pace was good, good amount of practice, and it was
easy to follow along. I thought python would be intimidating but it\'s
not :) +1+1+1\
I should have done this course months ago!! So helpful.\
Great meeting. It touched on so many points which would have confused
the hell out of me if I had started using Python on my own\
Ideal timing for this course, I need pandas this afternoon!\
It\'s a luxury to have such a dedicated and knowledgeable group of
instructors and helpers. Thank you very much! +10 :P\
You are definitely filling the gap on \'IT-content-teachers\' with the
proper teaching skills. Thanks!\
helpers are a great help, speaker is very good, thanks
